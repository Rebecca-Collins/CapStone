Oceanside United

Description:

I created the official website for a local women's soccer team to help the team connect with the community and potentially find sponsors. This web application allows fans and sponsors to login or sign up and interact with the team.
Features include:
* Commenting system: Users can make comments that are displayed on the site and stored on the server.
* User authentication and authorization: Only an admin user is able to delete a player and update the site.
* Interactive hover effects: The website uses hover effects to enhance user interactivity and provide a more engaging experience.
* Responsive design: The website is designed to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes, including mobile, tablet, and desktop.
* Dynamic timestamps: The website displays timestamps that are dynamically generated and updated in real-time.

Lesson Learned
One of the key challenges I faced during the development of this project was implementing user authentication and authorization for the admin. Initially, I implemented a system that worked, but was not efficient. After building out the site further, I decided to refactor the authentication process and pass down the necessary props to verify that the user is logged in and the admin. This improved the efficiency and reliability of the system.
Another important lesson I learned is the importance of managing and manipulating data. This project gave me the opportunity to practice working with data and displaying it in a clean and clear manner for users. I am now more confident and comfortable with these skills. Overall, this project provided valuable learning experiences and helped me improve my skills in user authentication, data management, and other areas.
